# SheduleBuddy

Central repository for all the code related to COMS 4111 Project 1 Part 3. 

### description

Our app allows users to create weekly repeating schedules for themselves and 
then overlay their friends' shedules on top of their own. This allows users to
easily spot windows of time when both they and their friends can meet up. Users
can then send one another invites to new events that will be added to both of
their calendars.
